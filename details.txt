The PHP Contact Form project is a simple web application that collects user details (Name, Email, Phone, and Message) and stores them in a MySQL database. The project consists of key files including index.php for the form interface, process.php for handling submissions, config.php for database connection, style.css for styling, and db.sql for database setup. The project is managed using Git for version control, with commands for initializing a repository, pushing changes to GitHub, branching for new features, merging updates, and tagging versions. To run the project, import db.sql into phpMyAdmin, start a local server using XAMPP/WAMP, and access index.php via a web browser. The form submits user inputs, storing them in the database for later retrieval. Git allows tracking modifications, ensuring seamless version management and collaborative development. The latest update includes a phone number field for enhanced data collection. This project demonstrates fundamental PHP, MySQL integration, and version control best practices.

Additionally, this project follows a structured approach to web development, emphasizing clean and modular code organization. The use of prepared statements can further improve security by preventing SQL injection. The front-end design is kept minimal yet responsive to ensure accessibility on different devices. Future improvements may include implementing client-side validation using JavaScript, adding an admin panel for managing contact submissions, and integrating email notifications for new form entries.

Git workflow in this project ensures smooth collaboration, allowing multiple developers to work on different features simultaneously. Pull requests and code reviews can be incorporated when working in a team. The tagging mechanism allows the identification of stable versions, making it easier to roll back if needed.

By following best coding practices and utilizing version control efficiently, this PHP Contact Form project serves as a foundational model for beginner developers looking to understand web application development, database integration, and software project management.
