The PHP Contact Form project is a simple web application that collects user details (Name, Email, Phone, and Message) and
stores them in a MySQL database. The project consists of key files including index.php for the form interface, process.php
for handling submissions, config.php for database connection, style.css for styling, and db.sql for database setup. The project
is managed using Git for version control, with commands for initializing a repository, pushing changes to GitHub, branching for 
new features, merging updates, and tagging versions. To run the project, import db.sql into phpMyAdmin, start a local server using 
XAMPP/WAMP, and access index.php via a web browser. The form submits user inputs, storing them in the database for later retrieval. 
Git allows tracking modifications, ensuring seamless version management and collaborative development. The latest update includes a 
phone number field for enhanced data collection. This project demonstrates fundamental PHP, MySQL integration, and version control best 
practices.
